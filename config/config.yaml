  split_params:
    test_size: 0.15
    validation_size: 0.25
    random_state: 42
    seeds: [42, 123, 789] #, 123, 789

# --- Common TF-IDF Settings and Tuning Grids (FOR FIXED VOCABULARY) ---
# Define an anchor '&common_tfidf_config' for these settings
common_tfidf_config: &common_tfidf_config
  # Hyperparameter Grids for Tuning TF-IDF scoring parameters (with fixed vocabulary)
  #tfidf_use_idf_grid: [True, False]
  tfidf_norm_grid: ['l1', 'l2'] # None means no normalization
  # You could add other tunable TF-IDF params if desired, e.g.:
  # tfidf_sublinear_tf_grid: [True, False]

# --- Model Specific Parameters and Tuning Grids ---

bayes:
  <<: *common_tfidf_config # Merges all keys from common_tfidf_config here
  # Bayes-specific parameters
  bayes_alpha_grid: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]
  #already balance calss weght
  # Example: If Bayes specifically should not tune 'norm' or use a different grid:
  # tfidf_norm_grid: ['l2'] # This would override the common one for Bayes only

svm:
  <<: *common_tfidf_config # Merges all keys from common_tfidf_config here
  # SVM-specific parameters
  C_grid: [0.1, 1, 10]
  max_iter: 10000

logistic_regression:
  <<: *common_tfidf_config # Merges all keys from common_tfidf_config here
  # Logistic Regression specific parameters
  lr_C_grid: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
  lr_max_iter_grid: [500] #100 iteration was too litle, 200, 1000 too many 
  lr_penalty_grid: ['l1', 'l2'] #before l2 was hard coded
